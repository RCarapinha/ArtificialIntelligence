# ArtificialIntelligence
Work done in Artificial Intelligence in 4th year passed in Poland.

# Laboratory 1 - Protégé

Ontology using Protégé. pratice with queries using the known Pizza Tutorial then a chosen ontology.

# Laboratory 3 - Markov Decision Problems

Markov Decision using Value Iteration and Q-Values. We have a 3x4 and a 4x4 map and the goal is to the agent go to the position with best value and best trajectory.

# Project

Football match predictor.

More information about every laboratory in the corresponding reports.
In this project, I will try to create a program that will analyze past-data and some other factors (using Artificial Intelligence) to try to predict the result of a game.

In a small evaluation, in 3 possible results it predicted 15/28 results, 53.6% accuracy. 

# What it must do
 
Analyze correctly the data and give some output of the next games.

#What I hope it does

Gives an accurate result of the next games.
